scenerio:

<br>
During both the one-to-one and the group discussion, there are three of us, including me, decided to take a web design corse this semester, even though we have barely any experience in digital design before. (The media that we are more comfortable with are printing based ones.) The reason weâ€™d choose the digital media is that we do realize that the digital graphic design is the most popular tendency in graphic design world by browsing and analyzing the temporary works. And the inquiry of digital graphic design is larger than the inquiry of printed graphic design. 
<br>
<br>
In other words, the TENDENCY, which is defined by the existing works, is making decision for many of the future designer.
